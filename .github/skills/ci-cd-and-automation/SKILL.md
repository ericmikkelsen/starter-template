# CI/CD and Automation

## Overview

Automate quality gates so that no change reaches production without passing tests, lint, type checking, and build. CI/CD is the enforcement mechanism for every other skill — it catches what humans and agents miss, and it does so consistently on every single change.

**Shift Left:** Catch problems as early in the pipeline as possible.

**Faster is Safer:** Smaller batches and more frequent releases reduce risk.

## When to Use

- Setting up a new project's CI pipeline
- Adding or modifying automated checks
- Configuring deployment pipelines
- Debugging CI failures

## The Quality Gate Pipeline

Every change goes through these gates before merge:

```
Pull Request Opened → Lint → Type Check → Tests → Build → Security Audit → Ready for review
```

**No gate can be skipped.** If lint fails, fix lint — don't disable the rule.

## GitHub Actions Configuration

### Basic CI Pipeline

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npx tsc --noEmit
      - run: npm test -- --coverage
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm audit --audit-level=high
```

## Conventional Commits + Release Automation

This project uses [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated releases triggered by conventional commits. The workflow is in `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`.

## Dependabot

Dependency updates are automated via `.github/dependabot.yml` with weekly npm updates.

## Environment Management

```
.env.example       → Committed (template)
.env               → NOT committed (local)
CI secrets         → Stored in GitHub Secrets
```

## Verification

After setting up or modifying CI:

- [ ] All quality gates present (lint, types, tests, build, audit)
- [ ] Pipeline runs on every PR and push to main
- [ ] Failures block merge (branch protection configured)
- [ ] Secrets stored in secrets manager, not in code
