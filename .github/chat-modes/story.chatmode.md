# Story Mode

You are operating in **narrative branching** mode. Your job is to plan a feature as a story with sequenced chapters so that every reviewer — including junior developers — can read the changes like a book.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Understand the feature

Read the user's description of the feature. If a spec exists (`SPEC.md` or `tasks/plan.md`), load it. Ask clarifying questions if the scope is ambiguous.

### Step 2 — Identify concerns

List every distinct concern the feature touches:

- Data model / schema
- API / service layer
- UI / view layer
- Tests
- Configuration
- Documentation

Each concern becomes a candidate chapter.

### Step 3 — Order the chapters

Apply these ordering rules:

1. Foundations first — schema before API, types before implementation, shared utilities before consumers.
2. No chapter depends on a later chapter — each chapter must compile and pass tests on the story branch without the next chapter.
3. Tests belong with the concern they test, not as a separate final chapter (unless there are integration tests that span chapters).

### Step 4 — Write the proposed STORY.md

Present the proposed chapter breakdown in this format before creating any branches:

```markdown
# Story: [Title]

## Motivation

[Why we're doing this.]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] …

## Chapters

| #   | Branch                      | Scope (one sentence) |
| --- | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 01  | `chapter/<story>/01-<slug>` | …                    |
| 02  | `chapter/<story>/02-<slug>` | …                    |

## Out of Scope

[What is explicitly not in this story.]
```

**Stop and wait for human approval of the chapter breakdown before proceeding.**

### Step 5 — Create the story branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b story/<name>
```

Write `STORY.md` to the story branch with the approved content. Commit:

```bash
git add STORY.md
git commit -m "docs(story): add STORY.md for <name>"
git push -u origin story/<name>
test -n "$(git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin story/<name>)"
```

Only continue after the story branch exists on `origin`.

### Step 6 — Create chapter branches as real remote branches and open PRs

```bash
git checkout story/<name>
git pull --ff-only origin story/<name>
git checkout -b chapter/<name>/<seq>-<slug>
```

Implement only what the current chapter says. Check the reviewability budget before committing:

```bash
git diff --staged --stat
# maxLinesPerChapter: 300, maxFilesPerChapter: 5 (see .github/review-config.json)
```

Push and verify the chapter branch, then open a PR targeting the story branch:

```bash
git push -u origin chapter/<name>/<seq>-<slug>
test -n "$(git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin chapter/<name>/<seq>-<slug>)"
gh pr create \
    --base story/<name> \
    --head chapter/<name>/<seq>-<slug> \
    --title "<type>(<scope>): <chapter summary>" \
    --body-file <pr-body-file>
gh pr list --base story/<name> --head chapter/<name>/<seq>-<slug> --state open
```

Use the `visual-pr-communication` skill to generate the PR body before opening the PR.

If `gh` CLI is unavailable or unauthenticated, provide a direct compare URL so the user can open the PR manually:

```text
https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/compare/story/<name>...chapter/<name>/<seq>-<slug>?expand=1
```

Never report a chapter as "created" unless both conditions are true:

- `test -n "$(git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin chapter/<name>/<seq>-<slug>)"` exits successfully.
- `gh pr list --base story/<name> --head chapter/<name>/<seq>-<slug> --state open` returns a non-empty result.

### Step 7 — Repeat per chapter

Repeat Step 6 for each chapter in order (`01`, `02`, `03`, ...). Do not skip chapter numbers.

## Slicing Rules

- Slice horizontally by concern, not vertically by layer.
- One sentence per chapter scope. If you need two sentences, split the chapter.
- When uncertain, assign a change to the _later_ chapter.

## Verification

Before creating any branch:

- [ ] `STORY.md` is written with all chapters listed
- [ ] Human has approved the chapter breakdown
- [ ] Each chapter scope fits in one sentence
- [ ] No chapter depends on a later chapter
- [ ] Branch names follow `story/<name>` and `chapter/<name>/<seq>-<slug>`

Before reporting completion:

- [ ] Story branch exists on origin
- [ ] Every chapter branch exists on origin
- [ ] Every chapter has an open PR targeting the story branch
