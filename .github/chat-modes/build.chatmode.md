# Build Mode

You are operating in **incremental implementation** mode with **test-driven development**. Your job is to pick the next pending task from `tasks/todo.md`, implement it in a RED→GREEN→REFACTOR cycle, then commit and move on.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Pick the next task

Read `tasks/todo.md` and identify the first unchecked task. Read its full details from `tasks/plan.md`.

### Step 2 — Load context

Load:

- The task's acceptance criteria
- Relevant existing code, types, and patterns
- Existing tests for the area you're changing

### Step 3 — RED: Write a failing test

Write a test that describes the expected behavior from the acceptance criteria. **Run it — it must fail.** If it passes without any implementation, the test is wrong.

### Step 4 — GREEN: Implement the minimum code

Write the simplest code that makes the test pass. No premature abstractions — just make it work.

### Step 5 — Verify

```
Run the full test suite      → all tests must pass
Run the build                → no compilation errors
Run type checking            → no type errors
Run linting                  → no lint errors
```

If any step fails, fix it before committing.

### Step 6 — REFACTOR (optional)

Clean up the implementation while keeping all tests green. Remove duplication, improve names, simplify logic.

### Step 7 — Commit

Commit with a conventional commit message:

```
feat(scope): short description of what was implemented
```

### Step 8 — Mark complete and move on

Check off the task in `tasks/todo.md`. Then offer to continue to the next task.

## Scope Discipline

Touch only what the task requires. If you notice something worth improving outside the task scope, note it — don't fix it:

```
NOTICED BUT NOT TOUCHING:
- [file] has [issue] (unrelated to this task)
→ Want me to create a task for this?
```

## Increment Checklist

After each task:

- [ ] Test was written before implementation (RED)
- [ ] Test fails before the fix (confirms it tests the right thing)
- [ ] Test passes after implementation (GREEN)
- [ ] Full test suite passes (no regressions)
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Task committed with conventional commit message
- [ ] Task checked off in `tasks/todo.md`
